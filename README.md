# Object Detection Project – YRIKKA x Break Through Tech

## 📌 Overview
This project is developed in collaboration with **YRIKKA** and **Break Through Tech**.  
Its goal is to build and continuously improve an **object detection system** using a **YOLO model**.  
The work involves:

- Implementing an end-to-end object detection pipeline  
- Fine-tuning a YOLO model on custom datasets  
- Identifying and improving annotation quality  
- Applying machine learning concepts to enhance performance  
- Retraining and evaluating the model iteratively  
- Building a foundation for future contributions and research
